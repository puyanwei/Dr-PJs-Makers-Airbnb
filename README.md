# Dr PJ's Makers Air Bnb
This web application allows users to list rooms they have available, and to book rooms. This was an one week group project of which we used the acronyms of our names;
[**d**avid-div](https://github.com/david-div), [**r**olandosorbelli](https://github.com/rolandosorbelli), [**p**yan83](https://www.github.com/pyan83),
[**j**enniferbacon01](https://github.com/jenniferbacon01), and
[**s**tephengeller](https://github.com/stephengeller).

I have written a blog [post](https://thep-log.blogspot.co.uk/2017/09/makers-week-six-grouping-up-for-makers.html) about my experience in this project.
